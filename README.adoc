= repo-labels

This is a script to automatically populate a respository with common labels for iTC use.

This script requires Ruby and the Octokit gem package to be installed.

== Usage

. Create a new repository using 'itc-wgtools/New-iTC-Template' as a template
. Create a new GitHub access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
. ./itc-labels coffeemaker/cPP 'abcd1234'

To create the respository from a template, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template[this help page].

When creating the personal access token for this purpose, it only needs to have repo access for the scope. This token can be deleted once the script has been run.

For the comman line parameters:

* coffeemaker: the organization name
* cPP: the name of the repository
* abcd1234: the personal access token

Note that the '/' is required in specifying the organization and repository.
